# openstack-agentic-skills

A collection of GitHub Copilot agent skills for OpenStack / Sunbeam development workflows.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| [cinder-spec-generator](cinder-spec-generator/SKILL.md) | Extracts oslo.config options from Cinder volume driver source and generates driver-spec YAML files for sunbeam-cinder-factory |
| [diagnose-sunbeam](diagnose-sunbeam/SKILL.md) | Diagnoses failed Sunbeam CI runs by analyzing sosreport tarballs, juju status files, and sunbeam CLI logs for multi-node OpenStack deployment failures on Canonical K8s |
| [openstack-skillwriting](openstack-skillwriting/SKILL.md) | Authors, reviews, and validates agent `SKILL.md` files following the Skill Authoring Guide (focused scope, triggerable description, compact main file, progressive disclosure, deterministic scripts, runtime validation, eval prompts) |
| [lxd](lxd/SKILL.md) | Workflows for LXD containers and VMs: launching Ubuntu instances, mounting host directories and storage volumes, defining reusable profiles and networks, and avoiding common automation hangs |
| [plot-fio-results](plot-fio-results/README.md) | Generates a 4-panel matplotlib chart (throughput, IOPS, latency, scaling efficiency) from rally-ci-churn fio benchmark result files |
| [sunbeam-networking](sunbeam-networking/SKILL.md) | Lab networking knowledge for Sunbeam/OpenStack: NICs, bonds, fabrics, VLANs, MAAS interface configuration, Juju space mapping, and onboarding guidance |

## cinder-spec-generator

### Configuration

1. **Copy the skill into your project's agent skills directory:**

   ```bash
   cp -r cinder-spec-generator /path/to/your/project/.agents/skills/
   ```

2. **Register the skill** by referencing it in your VS Code Copilot configuration (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` or workspace `.vscode/settings.json`), or place the skill directory under `.agents/skills/` in the target repository so Copilot picks it up automatically.

3. **Install the Python dependency:**

   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml
   ```

4. **Ensure a Cinder source tree is accessible** (default expected location: `../cinder` relative to your working repo).

### Usage

Invoke the skill via Copilot chat by describing what you want, e.g.:

> *"Generate a driver spec for the Pure Storage Cinder driver"*

See [cinder-spec-generator/SKILL.md](cinder-spec-generator/SKILL.md) for the full workflow, all options, and reference material.

## lxd

Symlink the skill into your agent skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.agents/skills
ln -s /path/to/openstack-agentic-skills/lxd /path/to/your/project/.agents/skills/lxd
```

Ensure LXD is available and the current user can run `lxc`:

```bash
lxc info
lxc image info ubuntu:26.04
```

The skill covers LXD container and VM launch patterns, readiness checks, host mounts, VM storage volumes, reusable profiles, managed bridge networks, and automation hang troubleshooting.

Validate from the `lxd` skill directory:

```bash
./tests/smoke.sh
```

See [lxd/SKILL.md](lxd/SKILL.md) for details.
